This is my first Ludum Dare entry ever and even though I didn't get as far as I wanted, I'm pretty happy overall.

Scenario:
The power of the world is running out--literally! The facility's power has sprouted legs and running away--it needs your help to escape its enslavement.

### Gameplay:
+ Move Left: A
+ Move Right: D
+ Jump: W
+ Killing: Touching enemies kills them, not you.
+ Dying: Look out--enemies will syphon you away with un-guns if you stand in front of them!

### Features:
+ You only have to play one level.
+ Enemies are dumb enough to kill.
+ All enemies look exactly alike so they're easy to remember.
+ No tedious loading screen--play immediately!
+ Times New Roman message at the end--really classy.
+ Sounds (in real, honest to goodness mono! probably).
+ Dope pixel art (though no pixel art of dope).
+ Enemies flash when they die.
+ No lame music. No music at all, but hey, at least it isn't lame!

### Technical Notes:
+ No frameworks / from scratch (Pure [TypeScript->]Javascript + Canvas)
+ Glorious high definition graphics lovingly crafted in MS Paint
+ Sound effects using Bfxr
+ Cross platform (i hope?)
+ Stream of consciousness pile of code mess made kindly available on the interwebz via github.
+ Comes with free bugs

### Changelog:
+ Added one commit slightly after 6 which "fixed" an audio-related bug which would cause jump sounds to not play sometimes / as often.
+ Fixed (fingers crossed) bug where enemies would be invisible on first page load.

### Timelapse:
Based on some time lapse snapshots I captured, looks like I was actively working at my computer for just about ~20 hours. :)
